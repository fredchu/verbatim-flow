# verbatim-flow

A fast dictation input app prototype for macOS.

## Product intent
- Keep latency low enough for everyday writing.
- Preserve original wording by default (no unsolicited rewriting).
- Allow optional formatting-only cleanup (punctuation, spacing, case).

## Monorepo layout
- `apps/mac-client/python`: runnable Python MVP (hotkey, recording, transcription, guard, inject).
- `apps/mac-client`: native macOS client experiments.
- `packages/asr-pipeline`: streaming ASR + VAD orchestration.
- `packages/text-guard`: format-only diff guard.
- `packages/text-injector`: global text injection abstraction.
- `packages/shared`: shared types and utilities.
- `docs`: architecture and technical decisions.
